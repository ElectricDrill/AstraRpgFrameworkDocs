# Limitations

<!--
- OnStatChangedEvent is risen only when modifiers are applied, not on level-ups/base stat changes
- OnAttributeChangedEvent is risen only when modifiers are applied and spendable points are assigned, not on level-ups/base attribute changes
- no support for multi-class per entity
- only one event for stats changed, attributes changed, entity spawned can be assigned to entities
